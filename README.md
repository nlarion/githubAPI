#GitHubAPI

####This is a website for displaying a GitHub's user account information and a list of recent repositories
####By: Neil Larion

## Description

###This is a project that allows the user to display information about a users github account by entering a username and pressing submit. It also meets the following gulp tasks:
* Concatenation, minification, and running the browserify package on your JavaScript.
* Building and cleaning.
* Running the development server with live reloading.
* Running JSHint.
* Compiling SASS.
* Automatically including Bower dependencies as vendor.js and vendor.css.

This project was developed during a "Code Review" session at Epicodus, which is a solo project designed to test our knowledge of the materials learned over the previous week's study. It's an honor to be apart of a coding community where people are genuinely interested in what they're doing.

## Setup/Installation Requirements
- Clone this repository.
- Move to the repo directory and run: "npm install"

- Finally run "gulp serve" to start the program
- if you want to run a lot of API requests get your own api key and create a .env file in the root directory file with the following: exports.apiKey = "YOUR KEY GOES HERE";
